# AWS-Lambda-Serverless-Sales-Analysis-Report-Generator
This project implements a serverless computing solution using AWS Lambda to generate daily sales analysis reports. The Lambda function is designed to retrieve data from a MySQL database running on an Amazon EC2 LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack. The data is then processed and emailed as a report to designated recipients every day.
